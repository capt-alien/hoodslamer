Plan of attack:

1) create project
    landing page?
    user?

2) create wrestler app
    define model
    write tests
    connect app to project
    create frontend
    pass tests

3) create match app
    define model
    write tests
    connect app to project
    create relation to wrestler app
    create frontend
    pass tests


4) create event app
    define model
    write tests
    find event management API
    connect app to project
    create relation to match app
    create relation to wrestler app
    create frontend
    pass tests


5) Polish everything:
    1) add serializer API
    2) customize admin pages
    3) add SECURITY features
    4) set up user models
    5) write global tests
