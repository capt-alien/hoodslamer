Hoodslam is an Oakland Cultural phenomenon. It is one of those aspects of Oakland
that makes Oakland Oakland and Not San Francisco. Hoodslam is a weekly backyard
"Professional" Wrestling event with outlandish characters that rip off pop culture
icons and stereotypes. It is a raging good time to say the least.

Hoosslam's website is not done well and could use improvement. This project will create a website with multiple applications that I could, in turn, give to Hoodslam in exchange for a permanent guest list status at their events and a teeshirt. This website will have a minimum of three internal apps and possibly a 3rd party application that will allow comments to be made on a particular match by the two contestants.

3 Apps:

1) Wrestler: The basic participant in the event. This page will include a quick bio and some stats of the wrestler such as wins/losses, weight, height, sex, affiliations, nicknames, birthdate, etc.

2) Matches: This will be comprised of two or more wrestlers and allow the fans to see which matches are happening at a given event. Before the event happens, the match will simply list the fighters, but after the event, it will list who won and who lost, as well as a quick synopsis about the drama which occurred in the ring. This part will also have a link to the online footage of the fight.

3) Events: This is the weekly events that are comprised of 5-6 matches that happen weekly. These pages will have a promo image, date of the event, the admission cost, date, links to facebook/twitter, and all the wrestlers featured in all the matches list ordered by the total number of wins the wrestler has. There will also be a link to the online ticket store. (if I get enough time, I will create an independent ticket handling page).
