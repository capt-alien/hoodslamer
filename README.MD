# hoodslamer

This project will create a website with multiple applications that I could, in turn, give to Hoodslam in exchange for a permanent guest list status at their events and a teeshirt. This website will have a minimum of three internal apps and possibly a 3rd party application that will allow comments to be made on a particular match by the two contestants.

2 Apps:

1) Wrestler: The basic participant in the event. This page will include a quick bio and some stats of the wrestler such as wins/losses, weight, height, sex, affiliations, nicknames, birthdate, etc.

to access go to:
<base_url>/wrestlers/
<base_url>/wrestlers/<name>


2) Matches & Events: Matches will be when two wrestlers do thir thing. Each match will bet 2 or more wrestlers and each event will have multiple matches.

To access go to:
<base_url>/events/
<base_url>/events/<name>
